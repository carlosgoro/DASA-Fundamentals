## Topic 1 - DevOps Evolution

### **Challenges with Traditional Ways of Working in IT Organizations**

* Low Creativity.
* Manual Releases.
* Low Quality.
* Product Backlog.
* Communication Problems.
* Sporadic Releases.
* High Cost.
* Less Happiness.
* Wall of Confusion.

Finding a solution to these challenges is necessary to survive in an extremely competitive and dynamic environment.


### **Wall of Confusion**

The wall of confusion between different teams of an organization occurs due to differences in their mindset (motivation and goals), processes, and tools.

The wall of confusion leads to many problems in production due to several reasons, such as:

* **Absence of a procedural transition from Development to Operations**: the Operation team faces challenges in production. It gets back to Development team for solutions resulting in delays.

* **Lack of communication**: the Operation team is involved in managing Production environment and can share relevant information which can help Development team. However, lack of communication results in loss of sharing.

* **Unavailability of sufficient knowledge articles**: the knowledge articles play an important role in building the cohesiveness between Development and Operation team. The knowledge articles include solutions to known challenges and are missed in the environment of conflicting interests between two teams.

The goal of DevOps is to change and enhance the relationship between the different teams of an organization by advocating better communication and collaboration.


### **Breaking down the Wall - The Challenges**

IT organizations face a variety of challenges due to the wall of confusion between the different teams. Tearing down this wall is, therefore, difficult due to the various challenges.

* **Organizational Silos**: Development and Operations teams work in insolation and interact only during the transition. This limited interaction cause unavoidable stress.

* **Different Mindsets**: the Development team attempts to introduce new techniques to bring effectiveness, while the Operations team resists these changes due to instability.

* **Different Tools**: Development and Operations teams use different tools, leading to errors and bugs. Both teams avoid learning tools used by the other team. The Development team uses tools such as Docker and GitHub, whereas the Operations team uses tools such as Jira.

* **Different Environments**: the different environments, such as Development, Test and Production, are one of the largest sources of errors and bugs raised by the different teams.

* **Blame Game**: both the teams try to blame each other for the bugs and errors, further escalating the stress between the two teams.

* **Build Rollback**: build rollbacks are frequently required to meet incorrect client requirements, incorrect database in the QA or Production environment, incompatible tools, and others.

* **Incohesive Processes**: the processes within two teams are generally based on different frameworks, such as ITIL, COBIT, and Scrum. The development processes do not integrate well with the Operations processes, leading to disjointed processes between both teams.

* **Biased Feedback**: the feedback loops get biased and result in a further escalation of confusion.


DevOps allows to bridge the gap between the Development and Operations teams by unifying then for better, faster outcomes.


**DevOps Story of Emergence**

DevOps emerged as the answer to the problems caused by the wall of confusion between Development and Operations. However, the emergence of DevOps has its own history and series of events.

Patrick Debois (Belgium), who is the father of DevOps, coined the term in 2007 for similar reasons.

## Topic 2 - Business Benefits of DevOps

* **IT**: IT is the strategic differentiator.

* **Speed**: Automation, Continuous Improvement, and Simplified Operating Models are the factors for moving fast.

* **Oneness**: Oneness is about no confusion among team members and between teams. In other words, everyone should be in sync.

To stay in business, organizations are more focused on the four key criteria:

1. Faster delivery
2. Improved stability.
3. Innovation.
4. Reduced cost.

DevOps supports the four criteria in delivering value to the customer with the typical synergy between IT Development and IT Operations departments. That is why DevOps is increasingly being used as an umbrella term representing a new IT order.

DevOps ensures a faster time to deliver the product, improvement in stability, room for innovative products or ideas, and reduction in production cost. These criteria are the most compelling business benefits of DevOps.

These four key benefits are driving organizations to break down the wall between business and IT. The organizations have started to realize that IT offers a strategic differentiation. Embracing a digital transformation is now key to survival, and the four key criteria are now placed high on the agenda of top management.


### **Why digital enterprises need to be Antifragile?**

> "Just as spending a month in bed leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened or even killed when deprived os stressors." Taleb, Antifragile.

Antifagility is the ability of systems (or organizations) to get better as a result of stress and tension (shock, disruptions, or disorder).

DevOps attempts to create this kind of environment by creating organizational units that can autonomously act on the software and hardware required to deliver the IT service.

DevOps requires short delivery times to ensure disruptions (in the form of different choices resulting from market changes) can readily be accommodated and used to improve the IT service.


### **Core Ingredients of an Antifragile Organization**

Antifragility is realized by three core ingredients:

* Management Innovation.
* Lean Startup.
* DevOps.

Enterprises need to focus especially on the DevOps part.


**Management Innovation**

* Multiply funding for new initiatives.
* Learn from the fringe.
* Community over hierarchy.
* Employees first.
* Ensure transparency in decision making.
* Kill bureaucracy.
* Think competencies and platforms.
* Honor web-inspired value.
* Reinvent management.
* Speed.


**Lean Startup**

* Implement experimentation systems.
* An experiment is a product.
* Instill entrepreneurship.
* Customer first.
* Validate learning.
* Minimum Viable Bureaucracy (MVB)/Lean.
* Think digital innovation.
* Honor end customer value.
* Self-management.
* Pivot.


**DevOps**

* Continuous iterative innovation.
* Embrace a culture of failing fast.
* Make DevOps teams responsible.
* Empower employees to put customers first.
* Short feedback loops and measure end-to-end.
* Systems Thinking, crossing silos.
* Innovate digitally and use cloud platforms.
* Honor end customer value.
* Self-management.
* Flow.


### **Impacts of DevOps Practices in IT Organizations**

The current fast-paced environment requires organizations to adopt new ways of working to be ahead of the competition.

When implemented correctly, DevOps culture cannot only transform your software process but also create for both employees and customers, ultimately enhancing your business performance.

By capitalizing on the DevOps benefits, organization can streamline the relationship between developers and the operations team, thereby making them more productive.

* Faster and Smarter Deployment.
* Agility is the Key.
* Reduced Risk.
* Increased Value Delivery.
* Increased Stability.
* Faster Time-to-Market.
* A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned.

## Topic 3 - DASA DevOps Principles

### **DevOps Core Principles**

1. **Customer-Centric Action**.
2. **Create with the End in Mind**.
3. **End-to-End Responsibility**.
4. **Cross-Functional Autonomous Teams**.
5. **Continuous Improvement**.
6. **Automate Everything You Can**.


### **Principle 1: Customer-Centric Action**

To be customer-centric, DevOps encourages an open organizational culture.

* **Feedback Loops**: people are open to feedback. Short feedback loops with the customers help organizations to focus on customer-centric actions.

* **No Bureaucracy**: bureaucracy is not at all encouraged, which results in more confidence and motivation.

* **Courage**: people are free to ask as many questions as they can. The aim is to bring everyone on the same stage with the 360 degree view of the requirements.

* **Risk Takers**: people have the authority to take calculated risks to achieve the desired goal.

* **Innovation**: people are more focused on creativity to produce valuable ideas to enhance the customer experience.


### **Principle 2: Create with the End in Mind**

Organizations should begin with a result-oriented plan with a complete understanding of the customer's requirements. Such an approach requires organizations to appreciate certain aspects (or characteristics).

* **Product and Service Thinking**: this thinking approach is about determining the problem that the end-users are trying to solve. When you know the correct problem, the solution you propose will surely solve the users's problem.

* **Collaboration**: always collaborate, keeping the end in mind, by defining the problem in advance (the agenda). It helps utilize the time more efficiently, create a process for accountability, and be more productive.

* **Engineering Mindset**: curiosity is the heart of the engineering mindset. It is the key to solving the given problem in a meaningful and valuable way.

* **Trust**: trust is essential to an effective team. It provides a sense of safety to open up, share the required knowledge, take calculated risks, expose vulnerabilities, and be more creative and innovative.

* **Early Feedback**: receiving early feedback about your products is crucial to adding more value and enhancing the user experience.


### **Principle 3: End-to-End Responsibility**

DevOps encourages organizations to practice the concept of cradle to be end-to-end responsible and taking control of almost everything.

* **Vertically-Oriented Teams**: the teams are organized vertically to deliver as much customer value as possible rather than just producing the outputs. Such teams pass through each stage of the product development process to deliver independent, valuable, and testable products.

* **Decision Making (Control)**: Teams are responsible for identifying a decision, gathering information, and assessing alternative resolutions. They have the authority to take calculated risks and make effective decisions.

* **Learning**: being end-to-end responsible, people collaborate to learn, adapt, and improve to deliver delightful customer experience. It helps them to acquire new knowledge and enhance their existing knowledge, skills, behaviors, values and preferences.

* **Performance**: the teams are responsible for providing end-to-end support to products that helps enhance their overall performance.

* **Simplicity**: end-to-end responsibility helps bring simplicity into the process by streamlining the work.


### **Principle 4: Cross-Functional Autonomous Team**

DevOps encourages organizations to create cross-functional autonomous teams that share the same goal, and hence the shared success.

* **Cross-Functional**: when the people from the different functional units with a variety of skills work together with the same goal, they can solve even the complex problems.

* **Autonomous**: such teams are independent and have the freedom to control things and make effective decisions when required.

* **Self-Directed**: people work for a purpose by setting a set of rules and deadlines as they do not have a boss or manager.

* **T-Shaped Profiles**: people are T-shaped, having deep knowledge and skills in a specific area of specialization and are capable of applying knowledge across disciplines.

* **Complementary Skills**: when people with different skills sets work together for a purpose, they share different viewpoints, which is essential to know the 360-degree view of the given problem.


### **Principle 5: Continuous Improvement**

DevOps encourages organizations to practice **Lean** to improve continually by streamlining work.

* **Structured Problem-Solving**: it is a systematic process to identify problem areas and work towards finding the correct solution.

* **Experimentation**: trying out new ideas is essential to maximize work and customer value. It enables you to measure the impact of the products or services that you are developing. Experimenting with new ideas requires the courage of failing fast and achieving the desired value.

* **Measurement**: ypu can improve if you can measure successes, people, and tools. An effective performance measuring system is, therefore, essential. It helps identify the required problems/challenges in the existing processes, proposed and implemented solutions, and products and services.

* **Minimum Waste**: continuous improvement is all about minimizing waste by removing the unnecessary activities from the value chain and streamlining the workflow.

* **Optimization**: the ultimate aim of continuous improvement is to innovate to optimize speed, cost, and ease of delivery. It requires experimenting out new ideas and the courage to learn from failures.


### **Principle 6: Automate Everything you Can**

DevOps encourages organizations to move away from manual efforts to automation to maximize customer experience and minimize human boredom.

* **Increased Productivity**: automation increases the productivity of people by automating the boring, repetitive manual tasks by maximizing the process flow. It helps them to utilize their time in doing some other work and be more innovative.

* **Improved Quality**: manual tasks are prone to human errors. Automation increases the overall quality by eliminating human errors at a faster rate and lower cost.

* **Consistency**: automation helps reduce errors as it produces results based on a defined set of rules within the code and increases performance due to the efficiency of the platform.

* **Increased Availability**: automation makes the systems more flexible by enabling these to perform 24x7, which in turn increases the turnaround time.

* **Scalability**: automation helps to make the systems scalable, which are essential to meet the everchanging requirements of the customers.


### **Exercise: Relation between DevOps Principles**

How do the DASA DevOps principles relate to each other? Create a matrix to show the relation between the variuos principles and their characteristics.

| DevOps Principles                 | Customer-Centric Action | Create with the End in Mind | End-to-End Responsibility | Cross-Functional Autonomous Teams | Continuous Improvement | Automate Everything you Can |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|

## Topic 4 - Goals and Measurements


### **Aspects of Measurements**

Establishing measurements at various levels is crucial to gather constant feedback on how the teams and the organization are performing. These levels are also known as aspects of measurement, as show in the following figure.


**Value**

* Value definition and measurement.
* Value driven prioritization.
* Optimized flow of value.

The primary success factor of any business is delivering the desired value to customers. It is, therefore, necessary for everyone in an organization to have a clear understanding of the customer value. The value helps you know how much are the customers satisfied. However, measuring usage behavior is important to understand whether the value is being delivered.


**Goals and Objectives**

* Shared goals.
* Cascading indicators.
* Transparency.
* Ownership.

Goals define the purpose that an organization wants to achieve. It defines goals at various levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. It is, therefore, necessary to measure whether the defined goals are met. They do this by setting the required objectives considering the various types of work to track the progress.


**Indicators and Metrics**

* Business-driven, end-to-end metrics.
* Rigorous automated measurement.

Metrics quantify operations results and provide the foundation required for evaluating and reviewing work in progress. It is, therefore, important to defined consistent metrics across the entire organization to deliver more value faster at a higher level of quality.

Indicators, also known as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), are calculated measures of performance against the achievement of strategic objectives and consist of a set of different metrics. These contain complex data and provide a more accurate view of whether everything is on track.


**Compliancy**

* Continuous compliance.
* Built-in controls and audit trails.
* Risk-aware and autonomous team.

Compliance push an organization to work according to a set of processes to comply with internal rules of conduct and external rules and regulations. Organizations must be able to easily provide evidence that they are compliant with these rules and regulations. These can be the company's written values, its ethics policy, the employee handbook, and policies for complying with legal obligations, such as taxes and corporate reporting. The organization should include these rules and regulations in day-to-day operations to minimize the effort required to prove compliance.



### **The Business Case for DevOps is clear but you need Goals**

Organization often fail to drive the full adoption of DevOps primarily due to people's resistance or lack of knowledge. The following figure lists the steps that can help organizations to be successful in their DevOps initiative.

1. **Formulate the Vision Statement**: express the WHY behind the DevOps initiative of the organization. The statement defines the need for applying DevOps principles.

2. **Identify Goals and Objectives**: recognize the short, medium, and long-term goals that the organization wants to achieve along with the corresponding SMART objectives.

3. **Define Measures, Indicators, and Metrics**: define measures, indicators, and metrics to track whether you are achieving the set goals.



### **Activity: Developing Vision, Goals, and Measurements for DevOps Adoption**

Identify and define the vision, goals, and measurements to successfully implement the DevOps way of working in your organization.

**Steps to follow**

1. Present the key points on how your organization should look like after embedding the DevOps way or working.
2. List the steps to achieve the goal, such as bring teams together with all necessary capabilities, focus on automation, and develop an improvement culture.
3. Set clear milestones, such as first CI/CD pipeline, first DevOps team, and first platform service delivered through a portal.

**Aspects to Consider**

1. Identify 2-3 possible measures to determine achieving your goals, such as release frequency and lead time.
2. Think about what it means to become a DevOps organization at various levels.
3. Do not worry if you are unable to complete the activity with specific detailing. You can add to this activity at various moments throughout the course.


### **Survivor Bias: choosing the right metrics**

It's the human tendency to get biased between successes and failures. People often encouraged by success stories ignoring the accompanying failures. 

Result: you can end up adopting opinions, organizing business, and making decisions without analyzing all the data due to lack of visibility and often lead to failures.

Survivorship Bias is the phenomenon of considering success stories along with the accompanying failures. It is the concept introduced during World War II. 


### **Actions based on Measurements**

If you do not take action based on the results of the measurements, there is no point in measuring. While measuring performance, you should consider asking such questions:

* What do we need to measure?
* Are we using the right techniques for measurement?
* Are we selecting the right KPIs for measurement?
* Will this measurement help the organization in improvement?

Metrics or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to measure performance. These are vital to understand whether the organization is achieving its goals.

The two key attributes of a KPI are quantifiability (you must be able to reduce it to a number) and that it directly captures a key business driver.


### **Performance Metrics vs. Performance Predictors (Lagging Indicators vs. Leading Indicators)**

Performance metrics and performance predictors are two types of measurements that help assess performance in a business or organizations.


**Performance Metrics**

* Performance metrics are typically output oriented, easy to measure, but hard to improve or influence.
* An indicator or pas performance that measures how we performed.
* Examples: weight, customer satisfaction.


**Performance Predictors**

* Performance predictors are typically input oriented, hard to measure, and easy to influence.
* An indicator that helps predict future performance.
* Examples: calories intake per day, user guide usage.


### **Top Practices (Leading Indicators) correlated to Performance Metrics**

IT performance or the performance of an organization is measured through two attributes: throughput and stability.

The leading indicators (and their practices) that make up the performance are:

* Deployment frequency.
    * Continuous Delivery.
    * Version Control.

* Lead time for changes.
    * Version Control.
    * Automated Testing.

* Mean time to recover from failure.
    * Version Control.
    * Monitoring System and Application Health.

To increase performance, organizations need to invest in practices that increase throughput and stability measures. The top practices that correlate with performance are:

* _Continuous Delivery_.
* _Version Control_.
* _Automated Testing_.
* _Monitoring System and Application Health_.

_Change Fail Rate_ is another indicator. The researches of the State-of-DevOps 2014 report did not find any specific practices correlating with this metric. But they did find that high-performing IT organizations have 50% lower CFR than the non-high performers.


### **Activity: Metrics for Throughput and Stability**

What kind of metrics can you use to measure throughput and stability?

* **Throughput**: Deployment Frequency and Lead Time for Changes.
* **Stability**: Mean Time to Recover and the ability to preemptively detect and mitigate problems.


### **Topic Summary**

The various aspects of measurements are:

* Value.
* Goals and Objectives.
* Indicators and Metrics.
* Compliancy.

The steps that can help organizations to be successful in their DevOps initiative are:

* Formulate the Vision Statement.
* Identify Goals and Objectives.
* Define Measures, Indicators and Metrics.

Survivorship Bias is the phenomenon of considering success stories along with the accompanying failures.

If you do not take action based on the results of the measurement, there is no point in measuring.

Performance metrics are typically output-oriented, easy to measure, but hard to improve or influence.

Performance predictors are typically input-oriented, hard to measure, and easy to influence.

IT performance or the performance of an organization is measured through two attributes: throughput and stability, which are essential for achieving IT.

Throughput is measured by Deployment Frequency and Lead Time for Changes, whereas stability is measured by mean time to recover.

## Topic 2 - Case Study - Easy Journey Airways

### **Exercise 2: Transforming EJ Airways**

Although several small Agile experiments and Lean initiatives were not immediately successful, Jonas Masters, CEO of EJ Airways, is considering embracing DevOps and transforming the entire organization to make that possible. With this aim, he has asked you to perform the following tasks:

1. Develop an elevator pitch on the benefits of DevOps. Emphasize the use of specific keywords related to the area of improvement.

2. How can EJ Airways implement the DevOps core principles? Which DevOps principles will be the most difficult to implement?

3. Create a list of proven combinations of performance metrics and performance predictors. Where should EJ Airways start?

4. Which metrics can assist in the preparation of a draft proposal for the insource part of the work that is currently done by partners/suppliers.

The 7 Reason for DevOps will most likely be part of the pitch. The Prediction model from the 2016 State-of-DevOps report is on of the ways to structure the pitch.

You should be wondering where EJ Airways could benefit the most. Benefits will most likely have to do with customer responsiveness and distinctiveness. Therefor, metrics will include Lead Time to Changes, Deployment Frequency, and MTTR (the common denominators for high-performance organizations).
